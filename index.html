"The response to our request for help with a large patio that needed repointing was good, dates were booked and Gary duly arrived on time armed with all the right tools. The 2 days were very hot but he worked through the challenge even replacing and resiting several slabs. Tidiness was maintained throughout. Gary was very courteous and extremely cooperative in the way to approach the problem. All at a reasonable price."</p>

"We had an old garden shed that was way past it's best and ordered a new garden shed to replace it, the concrete base for the shed had to be extended a little, as the shed was wider than the old shed.  A neighbour recommended this Horsham handyman, so I called them and they turned up exactly when they said they was going to.  They dismantled the old shed and took it away, and then laid a bigger concrete base for the larger shed, then assembled the new larger shed.  To say I'm VERY pleased with the result would be a gross understatement, the Horsham handyman was billiant from start to finish and the new shed looks brilliant.  Thank you.  For anyone looking to get someone to assemble a new shed, it's simple, just call the Horsham handyman."</p>

"Had a great experience with this Horsham handy man, my patio needed repointing, they were recommended from a neighbour, and sure enough the patio is now nicely repointed.  A great job and a great price as well, plus totally reliable.  For anyone looking for someone local in Horsham to do patio repointing, the Horsham handy man is the only one to call."</p>

"I only needed a couple of pictures and 1 mirror putting up, so was worried if the job was too small for someone to do, but I called this Horsham handyman and he said there's no job too small and no job too big, so a few days later the pictures were quickly put up, and no mess anywhere.  Very pleased."</p>

"Man on the phone for the initial enquiry, made it easy to book and completely understood exactly what I needed.
He sent Joe, lovely, hard working man that had to board my loft on a very hot day! So hot in a loft as well, you try it!
I told him I wanted it shelved and with little explanation he just did it. I couldn't have designed it better myself.
He turned up on time. Did a full days work and for an absolutely fantastic price. He also mended a kitchen cupboard for me as well. I would have no hesitation in recommending this handyman in Horsham to anyone."</p>

Adam is a thoroughly nice person who then went on to remove moss out of the top of a blocked guttering downpipe. Finally he took a look at our blocked bathroom sink but that turned out to be for another day.

"I needed someone to put up Christmas lights around the outside of my house, so I asked neighbours for any recommendations to anyone they thought would be good for hanging up Christmas lights.  I asked 2 neighbours and both of them said try the Horsham Handyman, as he can do most things.  I called the handyman and within a few days, the Horsham Handyman had arrived with all the right size ladders and put my Christmas lights up on the outside walls, plus in the outside hedges as well.  They turned up when they said they were going to, and did a really great job and at a fair price as well.  If anyones looking for a handyman in Horsham or nearby areas to put up their Christmas lights, this Horshamhandyman is the only handyman to call."</p>

"A fantastic experience throughout from the Horsham Handyman! They were very professional, knowledgeable and gave some great advice for our patio we needed laying. It was a very competitive price and was happy to go ahead and they offered a date in really good time to start.
<br>
<br>
The patio was actually completed by Adam who is part of the Horsham Handyman team and he really did an absolutely fantastic job. Again very professional, polite and considerate. He managed to complete the job earlier than expected to an incredibly high standard and we are really really happy with the result, it's an excellent patio that will last a very long time.  Attention to detail was fantastic and he also did a great clean up afterwards so all in all really impressed throughout from Adam!"</p>

"Perfection, professionalism, friendly.  I required some jobs doing around the home and contacted this Horsham handyman. He was polite and friendly on the phone. He tasked a gentleman by the name of Joe. I showed him the work that was required and he swiftly got on with the tasks in hand. At one point some wardrobe doors required changing and the new ones were different to the original doors. Joe looked at this in a methodical way and came up with a solution to be able to hang them and make them work. Joe did everything to perfection and I shall be using them again when I move in a couple of weeks. Once again thank you for a perfect and pleasant experience."</p>

"Our house had a serious ivy issue, we had just let it go on and on, thinking one day, we'll get the ivy removed, but kept putting it off.  It got to the stage where the ivy had grown all over the back of our house, at the highest point, the ivy had grown up the side of the wall to about 6 metres!  It was even starting to spread onto next doors house.

"We were recommended to this Horsham handyman by a neighbour who was very pleased with the work they had done for them over many years and we wanted 12 fence panels painted, and we knew from experience that spraying fencing with a sprayer doesn't always work that good, as it doesn't always get into all the little corners etc, so definitely wanted the fence painted with a brush.  Anyway, the Horsham handyman came and did a brilliant, very thorough job of it, using a brush and applying two coats, leaving adequate time after the first coat before applying the second one and now the fence panels and fence posts look absolutely brilliant.  I would have no issues at all in recommending this Horsham handyman to anyone wanting their fencing painted."</p>

"We had a strip of ground of about 6 metres long by about 2 metres wide at the front of our house which was full of weeds and also got very muddy in the winter, so we called the Horsham handyman for ideas on what to do with it, they suggested digging up some of it, then laying a membrane along all of it to stop the weeds coming through, then they gave advice on what sort of surface to top it off with and they gave advice on laying some slate, in fact they recommended plum slate for it as they said that would look great.  We went ahead on their recommendations and a couple of weeks later they arrived exactly when arranged, and the job they did looks absolutely fantastic.

"Matt arrived punctually at the time agreed. He removed the ivy that was in the top gutters and invading my upstairs windows!  He also jetwashed our courtyard garden and has brought the paving up like new, also making it safe for me to walk on in the wet where as before it became like an ice rink, as I found to my cost having had a bad accident on it some years ago.
<br>
Matt has done a wonderful job and I've already asked about a further job for possible autumn/winter.
The two jobs took about six hours and was so reasonably priced. My husband has tried jetwashing our courtyard in the past, that has taken 2 days, a very wet husband and a lot of swearing with nothing like the excellent results Matt achieved!<br>

"I had a big list of things for the Horsham handyman to do, including fixing 2 curtain rails to the walls, re-felting our garden shed roof, pruning some hedges and fixing a few wobbly paving tiles.  Excellent value for money, plus, they are totally reliable, turning up exactly when they said they was going to.

"I don't usually do reviews, but the service from this Horsham handyman has been brilliant.  Since 2019 they have come to my house every third Wednesday to carry out regular garden maintenance, which depending on the time of the year, includes cutting the grass, jet washing the patio, trimming bushes and shrubs, clearing away leaves, getting rid of weeds in the flower beds and patios, etc.  In all this time, they have been utterly reliable, and apart from around Christmas time, never missing any third Wednesdays.  They offer all types of regular garden maintenance, including monthly maintenance and weekly garden maintenance, I find every third Wednesday works great for me personally and not so much of a gap before they are back again.  However, I know they are totally flexible and will do the regular garden maintance whenever you want, with any type of frequency you want.  Fantastic gardening service and 100% recommended to anyone."</p>

Absolutely brilliant job and Matt was efficient, had pride in his work and a really nice person.

"The Horsham handyman has helped me over several years, from interior painting and decorating, relaying my patio, plus fixing some wobbly paving tiles on the drive, now, due to the recent storms, there were quite a few big fencing issues around the back garden, problems with broken fence panels and broken fence posts, so, I called the trusted Horham handyman and along they came and solved all the fencing issues, with new fence panels and new fence posts.  They did such a great, neat job of it all, that the neighbours asked them to do theirs as well!  I would totally recommend this Horsham handyman to anyone."</p>

neighbours have commented on good the new fencing looks.  I would also add, that

"We'd already used this brilliant company recently for some gardening work, 
which included cutting down quite a few trees. The Horsham handyman did such a great job that, when some of our upstairs floorboards needed lifting due to the floorboards creaking, he was our very first choice. Unfortunately for him, the floorboards had been nailed down very clumsily and their removal proved much trickier than anyone could ever have anticipated. Undeterred, this Horsham handyman persisted until late in the evening and, by 6pm, the job was done, no squeaky floorboards now and a lovely smooth surface for our new carpet.

"Joe worked hard in our courtyard garden and completed all the pruning and tidying that needed doing. Would unhesitatingly recommend him and his work.
He worked on tasks in our garden that we would have found difficult ourselves.&nbsp; We have used Horsham Handyman's services 3 times now - and have been totally happy each time. We have had work done indoors as well as in the garden.
Will continue to use them and recommend them without hesitation."</p>

"Neil arrived on time and was extremely friendly and helpful from the outset. He turned his hand to several different tasks when with us and we were delighted with everything he did.
He took down 3 old curtain poles and put up one new 4 meter one in their place.
He fixed a heavy mirror to the wall and also did a number of other jobs that involved cutting down an old bookcase and turning it into a couple of shoe racks.
We would unhesitatingly use him, and the services of Horsham Handyman, again and thank him so much for all he did for us."</p>

"The Horsham handyman has been AMAZING!! My garden was in desperate need of some TLC and was full of weeds and rubbish but they did a great job and it now looks like new again, he repointed and extended my patio, cut back a huge hedge at the bottom of the garden, and cleared away all the weeds and rubbish and he did it all with a smile! I have already booked him again to sort out my fencing - THANK YOU!"</p>

"I first found this Horsham handyman as a damsel in distress when I needed someone to clear some huge furniture out of a room that was due to be redecorated. Despite being fully booked he took pity on me and somehow managed to fit me in which greatly reduced my stress levels. I'll always be grateful to this handyman in Horsham for doing this and he has now become my 'go to' handyman. He has since erected blinds, put a mirror up in my bathroom, fixed a door that was sticking, extended a concrete path, fixed guttering and a downpipe to name but a few. No job too small and nothing is too much trouble as far as
this company are concerned. They are courteous, timely and hugely reliable.
I wouldn't use anyone else now. Everyone needs a handyman in their lives so the next
time home maintenance comes calling look no further and give them a call. Thanks Horsham handyman, what would we do without you!"</p>

team did a phenomenal job of it all, even though there wasn't much room around
it in some places! Good price, plus, they took away all the old fences and

"I have used the services of the Horsham handyman on two occasions. The first time he re-laid 'wobbly' garden paving slabs and washed very dirty velux windows inside and out. The second time was to tidy up and cut back trees, bushes and hedges front and back of the house. I cannot fault any of the work carried out by this company. He arrived on time and on the date agreed. The work was carried out in the time frame we had discussed and to a very high standard. I would not hesitate to use or recommend
the Horsham Handyman again."

"We have had excellent punctual, friendly and highly professional service from this Horsham handyman, they replaced two very difficult to remove fence posts, and reversed the fence panels, and installed a new garden gate. We asked him to return to replace a porch support post on another day. Meanwhile we had further storm damage, and were astounded that this Horsham handyman, with the help of Tony managed to repair everything that same day, including another fence post, and the construction of a small side fence by the new gate, and the dismantling and removal of an old rotten shed. This was really hard work and it was getting dark by the time they finished. We have no hesitation in recommending Horsham Handyman. We will no doubt be calling on his services again!"

"The main work that Neil completed was the renovation of the doors and windows of the wooden cabin /summer house in our garden. It had been neglected for several years and all the wood had warped, none of the windows nor the doors would shut. Neil from Horsham Handyman took the job in his stride, and after about three hours everything was opening and closing satisfactorily. He then renewed five window handles in the house which required cutting to size the screws and central spindle which came with each of the new handles, a job requiring tools and ability beyond me! Someone else from the firm is coming to hang a door for us next month (understandably they are a busy operation!) I would entirely recommend Horsham Handyman for this kind of work and I'm sure many other tasks besides - as they obviously complete tasks to a high standard."

"I only had a small job that needed doing, just putting up 2 roller blinds, I had a feeling that most handymen in Horsham wouldn't want to do such a small job, but I tried anyway, the 3 handymen I called, all said they would call back, but never did, then a
couple of weeks later, I was chatting to my neighbour about this and she said that the Horsham Handyman always does big and small jobs, so I tried them, got through to this Horsham handyman and within a week, both roller blinds were very happily installed in my house. Thank you to my neighbour for

"After the recent storms, our garden fencing literally took a severe bashing, with a
lot of the fence panels and fence posts, needing either to be repaired or
replaced. I looked around online for a fencing specialist in Horsham or
nearby areas, and saw all the great reviews for this Horsham handyman, called them and spoke to this Horsham handyman, who booked me in for the fencing job, despite them being
very busy, it was all done and completed within 2 weeks of first calling!&nbsp;
Very professional from start to finish and the fencing looks great, plus they cleared away everything, including the old fence panels and fence posts. I would have no hesitation in recommending this Horsham handyman and his team to anyone."

ever come across who actually turns up when they say they're going to! I had some leaky gutters at the front and back of my house, so I called another 'handyman' in Horsham, but he never turned up!&nbsp; I then called this Horsham handyman and left a message for him on his voicemail, he called me back, but because he's so busy, could only get to me a week later, but after reading the reviews for this handyman on this page, I thought it probably worth the wait to get someone reliable and who would do a good job, so booked him in, he turned up when he said he would and fixed both gutters.

There was 87 paving slabs in total, so quite a big job, but this Horsham handyman and his team were brilliant, they did a really great job of it, and left everything all neat and tidy, in fact it was all so good, that a neighbour saw the new patio and has now called this Horsham handyman to do the same for them.

us, he managed to fix a very tricky patch of creaky floorboards that were
driving us crazy in our bedroom, carefully managing to avoid any pipes or wires

"I would certainly recommend this Horsham handyman services. Please pass on to Neil that his sterling efforts seem to have stopped the leak in the Velux windows. Previously heavy rain, like we've had recently, would have caused water to come through the window. So please thank Neil and tell him he is now a Velux experienced repairer!"

I contacted this Horsham Handyman and they visited a couple days later and fixed them with a minimum of disruption and in a very professional manner. I would highly recommend this service."

"We had a very old, very big trampoline that was just going rusty in the corner of the garden after the kids had grown out of it, and we knew it had to go, but
it's very, very big! We called this Horsham Handyman, and he had it
dismantled and taken away in just a few hours. We also had a shed door that
never closed properly, plus a garden gate that would never close properly as
well. I mentioned these 2 jobs to them after they had finished the trampoline, and
both were solved in under an hour. I would have absolutely no hesitation in recommending the Horsham Handyman to anyone."

"We ordered some flatpacks from Ikea, 2 separate chest of drawers and 1 wardrobe that had an integral 2 drawers. I looked online for someone to assemble flat packs and found the Horsham Handyman. We then called the Horsham Handyman, they came along and assembled it all and it looks great. I have no

"This Horsham handyman with Ray have been the best handymen we could have asked for. They laid our new patio and fixed our very broken fence and were always happy and smiling even
though it was very hard work! They were incredibly professional, reliable and
tidy. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to everyone, their work is brilliant and we can't thank them enough for all their help."

"The Horsham handyman did a great job of fitting a new shed roof for us. He was recommended from a neighbour. Apparently, there's 2 grades of roofing felt, one that only lasts a few years and the other that lasts a lot longer, this one costs more than the cheaper version, but they fitted the better one, all within the same price. Well done to the best handyman in Horsham."

All this in the blazing hot sunshine! An excellent job and we would use this Horsham handyman for a range of other tasks needed doing.

"My initial enquiry was to replace the link from a rooftop gutter to the downpipe which had fallen off. This expanded to include preparing and repainting a couple of patches on the soffits. A late addition was a repair, sand down with power tools and repaint of soffits on the other side of the house. All work completed by the Horsham Handyman as agreed. All jobs needed done, but were too high up for me so would probably have been left for months. Very good to get them done and very prompt service."

"Saw the comments here as a result of looking around on the internet, because I needed my gutters cleared out as they were so blocked up, that the water wasn't
draining away down the downpipe, instead, the water was overflowing off the gutter and all down the wall! With lots of damp patches on the inside of the
wall as a result! I called the Horsham Handyman, he came and cleared out all the gutters (not that easy when the highest gutter is 6 metres high!) and unblocked
the downpipe, so that the water now flows freely along the gutters and down the downpipe. He's a nice guy, easy going and totally reliable. For a handyman in Horsham, I
would thoroughly recommend this Horsham Handyman service to anyone."
